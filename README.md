# Client Developer Marketplace

Group project for CSc 322: Software Engineering. In this project, we made an online marketplace for freelance developers who
want to showcase their talents to different clients. The clients can order to the site and choose a developer for the job
after a bidding phase. Once done, the client can review the software to see if all requirements are made. If not, a report
will be submitted to an admin and the admin will determine how much money will be paid to the developer.

# Technology Stack

This site is based on Flask and MySQL for backend. It is deployed to Heroku and it can be viewed in this link 
http://cd-marketplace.herokuapp.com/.
